Gaining the "Developer" Role on the Issue Tracker
=================================================

When you have consistently shown the ability to properly
:ref:`help triage issues <helptriage>` without guidance, you may request that you
be given the "Developer" role on the `issue tracker`_. You can make the request
of any person who already has the Developer role. If they decide you are ready
to gain the extra privileges on the tracker they will then act as a mentor to
you until you are ready to do things entirely on your own. There is no set rule
as to how many issues you need to have helped with before or how long you have
been participating. The key requirements are that you show the desire to
help, you are able to work well with others (especially those already with the
Developer role), and that have a firm grasp of how to do things on the issue
tracker properly on your own.

Gaining the Developer role will allow you to set any value on any issue in the
tracker, releasing you from the burden of having to ask others to set values on
an issue for you in order to properly triage something. This will not only help
speed up and simplify your work in helping out, but also help lessen the
workload for everyone by gaining your help.
