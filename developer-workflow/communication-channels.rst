==============================
Following Python's Development
==============================

Python's development is communicated through a myriad of ways, mostly through
mailing lists, but also other forms.


Standards of behaviour in these communication channels
======================================================

We try to foster environments of mutual respect, tolerance and encouragement,
as described in the PSF's `Diversity Statement`_. Abiding by the guidelines
in this document and asking questions or posting suggestions in the
appropriate channels are an excellent way to get started on the mutual respect
part, greatly increasing the chances of receiving tolerance and encouragement
in return.

.. _mailinglists:

Mailing Lists
=============

python-dev_ is the primary mailing list for discussions about Python's
development. The list is open to the public and is subscribed to by all core
developers plus many people simply interested in following Python's
development. Discussion is focused on issues related to Python's development,
such as how to handle a specific issue, a PEP, etc.

- Ideas about new functionality should **not** start here and instead
  should be sent to python-ideas_.
- Technical support questions should also not be asked here and instead
  should go to python-list_ or python-help_.

Python-ideas_ is a mailing list open to the public to discuss ideas on changing
Python. If a new idea does not start here (or python-list_, discussed below),
it will get redirected here.

Sometimes people post new ideas to python-list_ to gather community opinion
before heading to python-ideas_. The list is also sometimes known as
comp.lang.python, the name of the newsgroup it mirrors (it is also known by
the abbreviation c.l.py).

The python-committers_ mailing list is a private mailing list for core
developers (the archives are publicly available).
If something only affects core developers (e.g., the
tree is frozen for commits, etc.), it is discussed here instead of python-dev
to keep traffic down on the latter.

python-dev_, python-committers_, and python-ideas_ all use Mailman 3, and
are hence accessible via the Mailman 3 `web gateway`_.

Python-checkins_ sends out an email for every commit to Python's various
repositories from https://github.com/python/cpython. All core developers
subscribe to this list and are known to reply to these emails to make comments
about various issues they catch in the commit. Replies get redirected to
python-dev.

There are two mailing lists related to issues on the `issue tracker`_. If you
only want an email for when a new issue is open, subscribe to
new-bugs-announce_. If you would rather receive an email for all changes made
to any issue, subscribe to python-bugs-list_.

General Python questions should go to `python-list`_ or `tutor`_
or similar resources, such as StackOverflow_ or the ``#python`` IRC channel
on Libera.Chat_.

`The core-workflow <https://github.com/python/core-workflow/issues>`_
issue tracker is the place to discuss and work on improvements to the CPython
core development workflow.

A complete list of Python mailing lists can be found at https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo.
Most lists are also mirrored at `GMANE <https://gmane.io/>`_ and can be read and
posted to in various ways, including via web browsers, NNTP newsreaders, and
RSS feed readers.

.. _discourse_discuss:

Discourse (discuss.python.org web forum)
========================================

We have our own `Discourse`_ forum for both developers and users. This forum
complements the `python-dev`_, `python-ideas`_, `python-help`_, and
`python-list`_ mailing lists.

This forum has different categories and most core development discussions
take place in the open forum categories for `PEPs`_ and `Core Development`_
(these are the Discourse equivalents to the python-dev mailing list).
All categories are open for users to read and post with the exception of
the `Committers`_ category, where posting is restricted to the `CPython
<https://github.com/python/cpython>`_ core developers.

The Committers category is often used for announcements and notifications.
It is also a common venue for the core developer promotion votes (this
category is equivalent to the python-committers mailing list).

Tutorials for new users
-------------------------

To start a topic or participate in any discussions in the forum, sign up and
create an account using an email address or GitHub account. You can do so by
clicking the "Sign Up" button on the top right hand corner of the `Discourse`_
main page.

The Python Discourse `Quick Start <https://discuss.python.org/t/python-discourse-quick-start/116>`_
compiled by `Carol Willing <https://discuss.python.org/u/willingc/>`_ gives you
a quick overview on how to kick off Python Discourse.

We recommend new users getting familiarised with the forum by going through Discobot tutorials.
These tutorials can be activated by replying to a welcome message from "discourse
Greetings!" received under Notifications and Messages in your user account.

* Click on your personal account found on the top right hand corner of the page.
* The dropdown menu will show four different icons: üîî (Notifications),
  üîñ (Bookmarks), ‚úâÔ∏è (Messages), and üë§ (Preferences).
* Select either Notifications or Messages.
* Open the "Greetings!" message sent by Discobot to start the tutorial.

Ensure that you read through the `Python Code of Conduct <https://discuss.python.org/faq>`_.
We are to be open, considerate and respectful to all users in the community.
You can report messages that don't respect the CoC by clicking on the three
dots under the message and then on the ‚öê icon.  You can also mention the
`@staff <https://discuss.python.org/groups/staff>`_,
`@moderators <https://discuss.python.org/groups/moderators>`_, or
`@admins <https://discuss.python.org/groups/admins>`_ groups in a message.



Reading topics
-----------------
Click a topic title and read down the list of replies in chronological order,
following links or previewing replies and quotes as you go. Use your mouse to
scroll the screen, or use the timeline scroll bar on the right which also shows
you how far through the conversation you've read. On smaller screens, select the
bottom progress bar to expand it.


Notifications
-------------

Following categories (Category notifications)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Notifications can be set for individual categories and topics. To change any of these
defaults, you can either go to your user preferences, or visit the category
page, and use the notification button üîî above the topic list,
on the top right hand corner of the category page beside the "+ New Topic" button.

Clicking on the Notification control üîî will show a drop-down panel with 5
different options: Watching, Tracking, Watching First Post, Normal, and Muted.
All categories are set by default in Normal mode where you will only be notified
if someone mentions your @name or replies to you.

Following individual threads (Topic notifications)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To follow any individual topics or threads, you can adjust your notifications
through the notification button üîî found on the right of the topic at the end
of the timeline. You can also do so at the bottom of each topic.
Select "Watching" and you will be notified when there is any new updated reply
from that particular thread.

Customising notifications on user preference
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To get a bird's eye view of all your customised notifications, you can
go to `Preferences of your account <https://discuss.python.org/my/preferences/categories>`_.
This allows you to make adjustments according to categories, users, and tags.

Enabling mailing list mode
--------------------------

In mailing list mode, you will receive one email per post, as happens with
traditional mailing lists. This is desirable if you prefer to interact via email,
without visiting the forum website.
To activate the mailing list mode, go to the `email preferences
<https://discuss.python.org/my/preferences/emails>`_, check "Enable
mailing list mode" and save changes.

Discord (private chat server)
=============================

For more real-time discussions, the core development team have a private Discord
server available. Core developers, Steering Council members, triagers, and
documentarians on the project are eligible to join the server. Joining the
Discord server is entirely optional, as all essential communications occur on
the mailing lists and Discourse forums.

For core developers, a long lived multiple use invitation link for this server
can be found in the private core developer only section of the Discourse forum.

For triagers and documentarians joining the Discord server, a single use invitation
link should be generated and sent to them directly.

When first joining the server, new users will only have access to the ``#welcome``
and ``#rules-and-info`` channels. To link their Discord ID with their project
role, core developers may update their Steering Council üîí `voter record`_ with
their Discord ID before posting in the ``#welcome`` channel to request access
to the rest of the server channels. Triagers, documentarians, and core developers
that would prefer not to add their Discord ID to their Steering Council voter
record may instead be vouched for by an existing member of the Discord server.

As a private, non-archived, forum, final decisions on design and development
questions should not be made on Discord. Any conclusions from Discord discussions
should be summarised and posted to the issue tracker, Discourse forum, or
mailing list (the appropriate venue for sharing conclusions will depend on the
specific discussion).

Note: existing Discord users may want to right click on their username in the
automatic Discord welcome message and choose "Edit Server Profile" in order to
set a specific `Server Nickname`_

IRC
===

Some core developers still participate in the ``#python-dev`` IRC channel on
``irc.libera.chat``. This is not a place to ask for help with Python, but to
discuss issues related to Python's own development. See also the
``#python-dev-notifs`` channel for bots notifications.


Blogs
=====

Several core developers are active bloggers and discuss Python's development
that way. You can find their blogs (and various other developers who use Python)
at https://planetpython.org/.


Setting Expectations for Open Source Participation
==================================================

Burn-out is common in open source due to a misunderstanding of what users, contributors,
and maintainers should expect from each other. Brett Cannon gave a `talk <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Nk-8fSJM6I>`_
about this topic that sets out to help everyone set reasonable expectations of each other in
order to make open source pleasant for everyone involved.

Additional Repositories
=======================

`Python Core Workflow`_ hosts the codebase for tools such as `cherry_picker`_
and `blurb`_.

Python `Performance Benchmark`_ project is intended to be an authoritative
source of benchmarks for all Python implementations.
