Standard Library Extension Modules
==================================

In this section, we could explain how to write a CPython extension with the C language, but the topic can take a complete book.

For this reason, we prefer to give you some links where you can read a very good documentation.

Read the following references:

* https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/
* https://docs.python.org/dev/extending/
* :pep:`399`
