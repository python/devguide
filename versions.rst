Status key
==========

:feature: new features, bugfixes, and security fixes are accepted.
:prerelease: feature fixes, bugfixes, and security fixes are accepted for the
    upcoming feature release.
:bugfix: bugfixes and security fixes are accepted, new binaries are still
    released. (Also called **maintenance** mode or **stable** release)
:security: only security fixes are accepted and no more binaries are released,
    but new source-only versions can be released
:end-of-life: release cycle is frozen; no further changes can be pushed to it.

See also the :ref:`devcycle` page for more information about branches and backporting.

By default, the end-of-life is scheduled 5 years after the first release,
but can be adjusted by the release manager of each branch.  All Python 2
versions have reached end-of-life.
