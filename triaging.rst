Triaging an Issue
=================

This section of the devguide documents the `issue tracker`_ for users
and developers.

Contributors with the Developer role on the `issue tracker`_ can triage issues
directly without any assistance.

Additionally, this section provides an overview of the Python triage team.

Python triage team
------------------

The Python triage team is a group dedicated towards improving workflow
efficiency through thoughtful review and triage of open issues and pull
requests. This helps contributors receive timely feedback and enables core 
developers to focus on reviewed items which reduces their workload. The 
expectations of this role expand upon the "Developer" role on the 
`issue tracker`_. The responsibilities listed below are primarily centered 
around the Python GitHub repositories. This extends beyond CPython, and, as 
needed, to other repos such as devguide and core-workflow.

Responsibilities include:

* PR/issue management
    - Renaming PRs
    - Reviewing PRs
    - Closing PRs and issues
    - Assisting contributors
    - Notifying appropriate core developers
* Applying appropriate labels to PRs/Issues
    - Skip news
    - Skip issue
    - Good first issue
    - Other categorizations

It is also of paramount importance to treat every contributor to the Python
project kindly and with respect. Regardless of whether they're entirely new
or a veteran core developer, they're actively choosing to voluntarily donate their
time towards the improvement of Python. As is the case with any member of
the Python Software Foundation, always follow the `PSF Code of Conduct`_.

Becoming a member of the Python triage team
-------------------------------------------

Any Python core developers are welcome to invite a Python contributor to the
Python triage team. Do note that the responsibilities of a Python triager
is more elevated than a developer on bpo. For example, the Python triager
has access to more repositories than just CPython. Triagers will be responsible
to handle not just issues, but also pull requests, and even managing backports.

Any existing developers on b.p.o can transition into becoming a Python triager.
They can request this to any core developer, and the core developer
can pass the request to the `Python organization admin
<https://devguide.python.org/devcycle/?highlight=organization%20admin#current-owners>`_
on GitHub. The request
can be made confidentially via a DM in Zulip or Discourse, or publicly by opening
an `issue in the core-workflow repository
<https://github.com/python/core-workflow/issues/new?template=triage_membership.md>`_.

Any contributor who is not already a developer on b.p.o can also self-nominate
to be a member of Python triage team. They can request this to any core developer,
confidentially via DM in Zulip or Discourse, or publicly by opening an issue in core-workflow.
If a core developer agrees and is willing to vouch for them, the core developer
can pass the request to the GitHub administrator. They should also be added as
developer on bpo.

For every new triager, it would be great to announce them in the python-committers
mailing list and core-workflow category in Discourse. `Example announcement
<https://discuss.python.org/t/abhilash-raj-has-been-granted-triage-role-on-github/2089>`_.


GitHub Labels for PRs
'''''''''''''''''''''

An important component of triaging PRs for the CPython repo involves
appropriately categorizing them through the usage of labels.

Labels for PRs include:

DO-NOT-MERGE
    Used on PRs to prevent miss-islington from being able
    to automatically merge to pull request. This label is appropriate when a PR
    has a non-trivial conflict with the branch it is being merged into.

expert-asyncio
    Used for PRs which involve changes to the asyncio module
    or other asynchronous frameworks that utilize it.

invalid
    Used manually for PRs that do not meet basic requirements and
    automatically added by bedevere when PR authors attempt to merge maintenace
    branches into the master branch. During competitions, this label causes the
    PR to not count towards the author's contributions.

needs backport to X.Y
    Used for PRs which are appropriate to backport to
    branches prior to master. Generally, backports to the maintenance branches
    are primarily bugfixes and documentation clarifications. Backports to the
    security branches are strictly reserved for PRs involving security fixes, such as
    crashes, privilege escalation, and DoS. The use of this label will cause
    miss-islington to attempt to automatically merge the PR into the branches
    specified.

OS-X
    Used for PRs involving changes which only have an effect upon
    a specific operating system. Current variations of the label include
    OS-Windows and OS-Mac.

skip issue
    Used for PRs which involve trivial changes, such as typo fixes,
    comment changes, and section rephrases. The majority of PRs require
    an issue to be attached to, but if there are no code changes and the
    section being modified retains the same meaning, this label might be
    appropriate.

skip news
    Similar to the skip issue label, this label is used for PRs which
    involve trivial changes, backports, or already have a relevant news entry
    in another PR. Any potentially impactful changes should have a
    corresponding news entry, but for trivial changes it's commonly at the
    discretion of the PR author if they wish to opt-out of making one.

sprint
    Used for PRs authored during an in-person sprint, such as
    at PyCon, EuroPython, or other official Python events. The label is
    used to prioritize the review of those PRs during the sprint.

stale
    Used for PRs that include changes which are no longer relevant or when the
    author hasn't responded to feedback in a long period of time. This label
    helps core developers quickly identify PRs that are candidates for closure 
    or require a ping to the author.

type-bugfix
    Used for PRs that address unintentional behavior, but do not
    pose significant security concerns. Generally, bugfixes will be attached
    to a specific issue where the unintended behavior was first reported.

type-documentation
    Used for PRs that exclusively involve changes to
    the documentation. Documentation includes `*.rst` files, docstrings,
    and code comments.

type-enhancement
    Used for PRs that provide additional functionality
    or capabilities beyond the existing specifications.

type-performance
    Used for PRs that provide performance optimizations.

type-security
    Used for PRs that involve critical security issues. Less severe 
    security concerns can instead use the type-bugfix label.

type-tests
    Used for PRs that exclusively involve changes to the tests.

Fields in the Issue Tracker
---------------------------

The major elements found in an issue report include:

* Classification (including *Title*) - These fields categorize the issue.
  The fields include *Title*, *Type*, *Stage*, *Components*, and *Version*.
* Process - These fields indicate the state of the issue and its progress
  toward resolution. The fields are *Status*, *Resolution*, *Dependencies*,
  *Superseder*, *Assigned To*, *Nosy List*, *Priority*, *Keywords*, *Comment*,
  *File*, *File Description*, *Remote hg repo*, *GitHub PR*.
* Messages
* History

Title
'''''
A brief description of the issue. Review whether the title is too generic or
specifies an incorrect term or library.

(Optional) Add a prefix at the start of the title to indicate the module, e.g.
IDLE, doc, or asyncio.

Type
''''
Describes the type of issue.  If an issue does not fit within any
specific type, please do not set a type.

+----------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
|      Type      |                       Description                        |
+================+==========================================================+
| behavior       | Unexpected behavior, result, or exception.  Most bugs    |
|                | will have this type.                                     |
+----------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| compile error  | Errors reported by the compiler while compiling Python.  |
+----------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| crash          | Hard crashes of the Python interpreter -- possibly with  |
|                | a core dump or a Windows error box.                      |
+----------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| enhancement    | Issues that propose the addition of new functionality,   |
|                | such as new functions, classes, modules, or even new     |
|                | arguments for existing functions. Also used for          |
|                | improvements in the documentation, test suite and        |
|                | other refactorings. A good place to discuss enhancements |
|                | prior to filing an issue is `python-ideas`_ mailing      |
|                | list.                                                    |
+----------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| performance    | Situations where too much time is necessary to complete  |
|                | the task. For example, a common task now takes           |
|                | significantly longer to complete.                        |
+----------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| resource usage | Situations where too many resources (e.g. memory) are    |
|                | used.                                                    |
+----------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| security       | Issues that might have security implications. Report     |
|                | security vulnerabilities using the procedure found in    |
|                | the `Reporting security issues in Python`_ page on the   |
|                | python.org website.                                      |
+----------------+----------------------------------------------------------+

Stage
'''''
A needed next action to advance the issue.  The *stage* needn't be set until
it is clear that the issue has been initially triaged and determined work
will be needed.

+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
|     Stage     |                       Description                        |
+===============+==========================================================+
| test needed   | The steps which are needed to reproduce the issue. The   |
|               | bug reporter should post a script, instructions, or      |
|               | example to help someone test or reproduce the issue.     |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| needs patch   | A patch or pull request is needed to solve the problem   |
|               | (i.e. fixing the bug or adding the requested             |
|               | improvement).                                            |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| patch review  | A patch or pull request exists, but it needs review.     |
|               | Any triager or core developer may do the review.         |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| commit review | A triager performed a patch review and it looks good.    |
|               | This signals to core developers the patch or pull        |
|               | request needs a quick once-over to make sure nothing was |
|               | overlooked before committing it.                         |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| resolved      | The issue is considered closed and addressed (e.g. patch |
|               | or pull request committed; expected behavior).           |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------+

Components
''''''''''
The area or Python library affected by the issue. This is a multi-select field.

Choosing certain components, such as `Documentation`, may cause the issue to

Versions
''''''''
The known versions of Python that the issue affects and should be fixed for.

Thus if an issue for a new feature is assigned for e.g., Python 3.8 but is not
applied before Python 3.8.0 is released, this field should be updated to say
Python 3.9 as the version and drop Python 3.8.

Priority
''''''''
What is the severity and urgency?

+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Priority         | Description                                            |
+==================+========================================================+
| low              | This is for low-impact bugs.                           |
+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| normal           | The default value for most issues filed.               |
+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| high             | Try to fix the issue before the next final release.    |
+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| critical         | Should definitely be fixed for next final release.     |
+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| deferred blocker | The issue will not hold up the next release, *n*. It   |
|                  | will be promoted to a *release blocker* for the        |
|                  | following release, *n+1*.                              |
+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| release blocker  | The issue **must** be fixed before *any* release is    |
|                  | made, e.g., will block the next release even if it is  |
|                  | an alpha release.                                      |
+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+

As a guideline, *critical* and above are usually reserved for crashes,
serious regressions or breakage of very important APIs.  Whether a bug
is a *release blocker* for the current `release schedule`_ is decided by the
release manager. Triagers may recommend this priority and should add the
release manager to the *nosy list*. If needed, consult the
`release schedule`_ and the release's associated PEP for the release
manager's name.

Keywords
''''''''
Various informational flags about the issue. Multiple values are possible.

Nosy List
'''''''''
A list of people who may be interested in an issue.

It is acceptable to add someone to the nosy list if you think the issue should
be brought to their attention. Use the :ref:`experts` to know who wants to be
added to the nosy list for issues targeting specific areas.

If you are logged in and have JavaScript enabled, you can use the ``[+]``
button to add yourself to the nosy list (remember to click on
"Submit Changes" afterwards).  Note that you are added to the nosy
automatically when you submit a message.

The nosy list also has an autocomplete that lets you search from the lists of
developers and :ref:`experts`.  The search is case-insensitive and
works for real names, modules, interest areas, etc., and only adds the
username(s) to the nosy once an entry is selected.

Assigned To
'''''''''''
Who is expected to take the next step in resolving the issue.

It is acceptable to assign an issue to someone if the issue cannot move
forward without their help, e.g., they need to make a technical decision to
allow the issue to move forward. Also consult the :ref:`experts` as certain
stdlib modules should always be assigned to a specific person.

Note that in order to assign an issue to someone, that person **must** have
the :ref:`Developer role <devrole>` on the issue tracker.

Dependencies
''''''''''''
The issue requires the listed issue(s) to be resolved first before it can move
forward.

Superseder
''''''''''
The issue is a duplicate of the listed issue(s).

Status
''''''

+---------------+------------------------------------------------------------+

| pending       | The issue is blocked until someone (often the              |
|               | :abbr:`OP (original poster)`) provides some critical       |
|               | information; the issue will be closed after a set amount   |
|               | time if no reply comes in.                                 |

|               | Useful when someone opens an issue that lacks enough       |
|               | information to reproduce the bug reported.  Requesting     |
|               | additional information and setting status to *pending*     |
|               | indicates that the issue should be closed if the necessary |
|               | information is not provided in a timely manner (i.e. one   |
|               | month).                                                    |
