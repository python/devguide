Translating
===========

.. highlight::  rest

There are several documentation translations already
in production; others are works in progress. To get started read your
repositories contributing guide, which is generally the ``README``
file, and this page.
If your language isn’t listed below, feel free to start the translation!
See :doc:`coordinating` on how to get started.

For more details about translations and their progress, see `the dashboard
<https://python-docs-translations.github.io/dashboard/>`__.

How to get help
===============

If there is already a repository for your language team (there may be links to
Telegrams/Discords in the ``README``), join and introduce
yourself, your fellow translators will be more than happy to help! XXX sounds off
General discussions about translations occur on the Python Docs Discord
`#translations channel <https://discord.gg/h3qDwgyzga>`_, `translation
mailing list <translation_ml_>`_, and the `translations subsection <_discourse>`_
of the Python Discourse.


Style Guide
===========

Before translating, you should familiarize yourself with the general
documentation :doc:`style guide<../style-guide>`. Some translation specific
guidelines are explained below.


Roles and links
---------------

The Python docs contain many roles (``:role:`target```)
to other parts of the documentation.
Leave reStructuredText roles such as ``:func:`print``` or ``:ref:`some-section``` in
place, even if they contain section titles, because it will break the link.
If alternate text (``:role:`text <target>``` is provided, it can be translated.

Links (```text <target>`_``) should be handled similarly.

.. XXX do we want to switch links to target language if possible, ES translation does this (and I do too sometimes...)?

.. seealso::
   :doc:`../markup`


Code examples
-------------

Translate values in code examples, that is string literals, and comments.
These may be lines from Monty Python skits or other references, they are, however,
sometimes obscure and lose meaning when translated, so do not feel pressured
to get them perfect.

.. XXX Ask EB can we do this QOL improvement?/Reword too

Don't translate keywords or names, including variable, function, class, argument,
and attribute names. An example of a translated codeblock from the `tutorial <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#keyword-arguments>`_
is provided below:

.. code-block:: python

   def cheeseshop(kind, *arguments, **keywords):
       print("-- Czy jest może", kind, "?")
       print("-- Przykro mi, nie mamy już sera", kind)
       for arg in arguments:
           print(arg)
       print("-" * 40)
       for kw in keywords:
           print(kw, ":", keywords[kw])


Translation quality
-------------------

Translators should be proficient in both English and the language they are
translating to. Translators should aim for a similar level of quality as that
of the English documentation.

Avoid relying solely on machine translation. These tools can be useful to speed up
work, but often produce inaccurate or misleading results and should be reviewed.
.. XXX ask EB about permission for this section or maybe https://github.com/python/peps/pull/4296/ to ref


Vocabulary
----------

The documentation is full of technical terms, some are common in general
programming and have translations, whereas others are specific to Python.
Translations should keep the translations of these terms consistent, which is
done with glossaries/translation memory.

.. XXX Reword above
.. XXX note that in coordinating.rst

Some general guidelines for deciding on a translation:

.. XXX todo (a lot)

- Use existing community conventions over inventing new terms.
- Use hybrid form
- Use English for common terms ... maybe hard to desc this case
- Use your best judgment
- Use other translations for reference as to what to do
- Be careful to not translate names
- Record in glossary to help peers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Dialects
--------

Some translation receive contributions from people of many different dialects,
understandably the language will differ, it is recommended however that
translators try to keep files/large sections consistent.


Transifex
=========

.. XXX maybe add quickstart?

.. important::

   There are many translations in the `python transifex <tx_>`_, some of which,
   however, not used anymore or do not have a coordinator, please confirm this
   is not the case before you begin translating.

Translations on Transifex are carried out via a web interface, similar to Weblate.
For further information about Transifex, and our guides on getting started, see
our `documentation <https://python-docs-transifex-automation.readthedocs.io/new-translators.html>`_.
.. XXX Move stuff here, discuss w Rafael?

If you need help from a Transifex administrator, open an issue on the
`tracker <https://github.com/python-docs-translations/transifex-automations/issues>`_.
.. XXX explain that it is not same as coordinator


Translation FAQ
===============

Which version of the Python documentation should I work on?
-----------------------------------------------------------

You should work on the latest branch available for you translation, the translations
should then be propagated by the languages coordinator.


The coordinator for my language is inactive, what do I do?
----------------------------------------------------------

If you would like to coordinate, follow the (necessary) steps outlined in
:doc:`coordinating` and open an issue in the
`EB issue tracker <https://github.com/python/editorial-board/issues>`_.

.. XXX Ask EB if this is ok
