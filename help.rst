Where to Get Help
=================
If you are working on Python it is very possible you will come across an issue
where you need some assistance in solving (this happens to core developers all
the time). You have a couple of options depending on what kind of help you need.
If the question involves process or tool usage then please check the developer's
guide first as is should answer your question.


File a Bug
----------
If you come across an odd error message that seems like a bug, then file a bug
on the `issue tracker`_. In the bug you can explain that you are not sure why
the error is coming up or that the exact nature of the problem is. Someone will
come along and help you diagnose the problem, evolving the bug report into a
more concrete issue.

Ask (#)python-dev
-----------------
You have two avenues of communication out of the :ref:`myriad of options
available <communication>`. If you are comfortable with IRC you can try asking
in #python-dev. Typically there are a couple of experienced developers, ranging
from triagers to core developers, who can ask questions about developing for
Python. If you prefer email you can email python-dev for help with your
question. Just remember that both avenues are for questions involving the
development *of* Python, **not** for development *with* Python.
