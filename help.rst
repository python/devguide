Where to Get Help
=================

When working on Python, it is possible that you will come across an issue
where you need some assistance to solve it.  This happens to core developers
all the time.

We try to foster environments of mutual respect, tolerance, and encouragement,
as described in the PSF's `Diversity Statement`_.  Abiding by the guidelines
in this document when asking questions or posting suggestions in the
appropriate channels are an excellent way to get started on the mutual respect
part, greatly increasing the chances of receiving tolerance and encouragement
in return.

General Python questions
------------------------

General questions about Python can be asked in `python-list`_ or `tutor`_
mailing lists. You may also want to post your question in StackOverflow_ or
the ``#python`` IRC channel on freenode_.

.. _python-list: http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-list
.. _tutor: http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tutor
.. _StackOverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/


Ask #python-dev
---------------

If you are comfortable with IRC you can try asking on ``#python-dev`` (on
the `freenode`_ network). Typically there are a number of experienced
developers, ranging from triagers to core developers, who can answer
questions about developing for Python.  Just remember that ``#python-dev``
is for questions involving the development *of* Python whereas ``#python``
is for questions concerning development *with* Python.

Core Mentorship
---------------

If you are interested in improving Python and contributing to its development,
but donâ€™t yet feel entirely comfortable with the public channels mentioned
above, `Python Mentors`_ are here to help you.  Python is fortunate to have a
community of volunteer core developers willing to mentor anyone wishing to
contribute code, work on bug fixes or improve documentation.  Everyone is
welcomed and encouraged to contribute.

Mailing Lists
-------------

Further options for seeking assistance include the `python-ideas`_ and
`python-dev`_ mailing lists. Python-ideas contains discussion of speculative
Python language ideas for possible inclusion into the language. If an idea
gains traction it can then be discussed and honed to the point of becoming a
solid proposal and presented on python-dev.  Python-dev contains discussion
of current Python design issues, release mechanics, and maintenance of
existing releases.  As with ``#python-dev``, these mailing lists are for
questions involving the development *of* Python, **not** for development
*with* Python.

File a Bug
----------

If you strongly suspect you have stumbled on a bug (be it in the build
process, in the test suite, or in other areas), then open an issue on the
`issue tracker`_.  As with every bug report it is strongly advised that
you detail which conditions triggered it (including the OS name and version,
and what you were trying to do), as well as the exact error message you
encountered.
