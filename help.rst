Where to Get Help
=================

If you are working on Python it is very possible you will come across an issue
where you need some assistance to solve it (this happens to core developers
all the time).

Should you require help, there are a :ref:`variety of options available
<communication>` to seek assistance. If the question involves process or tool
usage then please check the rest of this guide first as it should answer your
question.


Ask #python-dev
---------------

If you are comfortable with IRC you can try asking on ``#python-dev`` (on
the `freenode`_ network). Typically there are a number of experienced
developers, ranging from triagers to core developers, who can answer
questions about developing for Python.  Just remember that ``#python-dev``
is for questions involving the development *of* Python whereas ``#python``
is for questions concerning development *with* Python.

  You may not be able to access the history of this channel, so it cannot
  be used as a "knowledge base" of sorts.

Zulip
-----

An alternative to IRC is our own `Zulip`_ instance.  There are different streams
for asking help with core development, as well as core developers' office
hour stream. It is preferred that you ask questions here first or schedule
an office hour, before posting to python-dev mailing list or filing bugs.

.. _Zulip: https://python.zulipchat.com

Discourse
---------

Python has a hosted `Discourse`_ instance. Be sure to visit the related Core
categories, such as Core Development and Core Workflow.

.. _Discourse: https://discuss.python.org/


Core Mentorship
---------------

If you are interested in improving Python and contributing to its development,
but don’t yet feel entirely comfortable with the public channels mentioned
above, `Python Mentors`_ are here to help you.  Python is fortunate to have a
community of volunteer core developers willing to mentor anyone wishing to
contribute code, work on bug fixes or improve documentation.  Everyone is
welcomed and encouraged to contribute.

.. _office hour:

Core Developers Office Hours
----------------------------

Several core developers have set aside time to host mentorship office hours.
During the office hour, core developers are available to help contributors with
our process, answer questions, and help lower the barrier of contributing and
becoming Python core developers.

The PSF's code of conduct applies for interactions with core developers
during office hours.

Mailing Lists
-------------

Further options for seeking assistance include the `python-ideas`_ and
`python-dev`_ mailing lists. Python-ideas contains discussion of speculative
Python language ideas for possible inclusion into the language. If an idea
gains traction it can then be discussed and honed to the point of becoming a
solid proposal and presented on python-dev.  Python-dev contains discussion
of current Python design issues, release mechanics, and maintenance of
existing releases.  As with ``#python-dev``, these mailing lists are for
questions involving the development *of* Python, **not** for development
*with* Python.

File a Bug
----------

If you strongly suspect you have stumbled on a bug (be it in the build
process, in the test suite, or in other areas), then open an issue on the
`issue tracker`_.  As with every bug report it is strongly advised that
you detail which conditions triggered it (including the OS name and version,
and what you were trying to do), as well as the exact error message you
encountered.
