Where to Get Help
=================

If you are working on Python it is very possible you will come across an issue
where you need some assistance to solve it (this happens to core developers
all the time). Below are some options on getting help.

If the question involves process or tool usage then please check other parts of
this guide first as it should answer your question.


Ask (#)python-dev
-----------------

You have two avenues of communication out of the :ref:`myriad of options
available <communication>`. If you are comfortable with IRC you can try asking
on ``#python-dev`` (on the `freenode <http://freenode.net/>`_ network).
Typically there are a couple of experienced developers, ranging from
triagers to core developers, who can answer questions about developing for
Python. If you prefer email you can ask the `python-dev mailing-list
<http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-dev>`_ for help with your
question. Just remember that both avenues are for questions involving the
development *of* Python, **not** for development *with* Python.


File a Bug
----------

If you strongly suspect you have stumbled on a bug (be it in the build
process, in the test suite, or in other areas), then open a issue on the
`issue tracker`_.  As with every bug report it is strongly advised that
you detail which conditions triggered it (including the OS name and version,
and what you were trying to do), as well as the exact error message you
encountered.
