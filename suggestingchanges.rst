Suggesting new features and language changes
============================================

The `python-ideas`_ mailing list is specifically intended for discussion of
new features and language changes. Please don't be disappointed if your
idea isn't met with universal approval: as the long list of Rejected and
Withdrawn PEPs in the `PEP Index`_ attests, and as befits a reasonably mature
programming language, getting significant changes into Python isn't a simple
task.

If the idea is reasonable, someone will suggest posting it as a feature
request on the `issue tracker`_, or, for larger changes, writing it up as
a `draft PEP`_.

Sometimes core developers will differ in opinion, or merely be collectively
unconvinced. When there isn't an obvious victor then the
`Status Quo Wins a Stalemate`_ as outlined in the linked post.

For some examples on language changes that were accepted please read
`Justifying Python Language Changes`_.
