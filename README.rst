This guide covers how to contribute to CPython. It is known by the
nickname of "the devguide" by the Python core developers.

The official home of this guide is https://docs.python.org/devguide/,
but an up-to-date mirror of this repository is also available at
http://cpython-devguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ (use the mirror if
you want to verify that a recent change worked well as the copy on
docs.python.org is updated only a few times a day).

If you wish to contribute to updating the devguide then please submit
PRs to the
`github branch <https://github.com/python/devguide/tree/github>`_.
