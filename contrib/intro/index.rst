Welcome!

New to open source?
===================

Python is an open source project, with culture and techniques from the broader
open source world.  You might find it helpful to read about open source in
general.  A number of individuals from the Python community have contributed to
a series of excellent guides at `Open Source Guides
<https://opensource.guide/>`_.

Anyone will find the following guides useful:

* `How to Contribute to Open Source <https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/>`_
* `Building Welcoming Communities <https://opensource.guide/building-community/>`_


Healthy collaboration
=====================

[Importance of healthy inclusive collaboration]

[While code is a large part of the project's success, project management, documentation, governance, sprint outreach, etc. matter.]

[We respect the individual skills people bring to the project and strive to create and maintain a culture of inclusion.]
