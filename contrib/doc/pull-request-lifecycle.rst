[Details of pull requests for documentation contributions. The existing
:ref:`pull-request-lifecycle` page is long and includes many details.
Some only apply to code contributions, but many are common to all
contributions.  Should we keep a common page, with documentation tweaks here, or
should this page have only the documentation details even if they are duplicated
elsewhere?]

[See :ref:`code-pull-request-lifecycle` for the code half of this conundrum.]
