   |purpose|


This guide is a comprehensive resource for contributing to Python.

.. note::
   This is a draft of a new organization for the devguide, turning it into a
   Contributor's Guide.

[Much of the devguide home page will be here.  The Quick Start will be updated
to distinguish code vs documentation contributions, and moved to those
sections.  Other changes will be made to explain the different types of
contribution and how to navigate the guide for your own type.]
