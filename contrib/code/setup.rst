.. _configure-cache:

Using Configure Cache (`configure -C`)
--------------------------------------

When running `./configure`, CPython performs a series of system checks, which can take time.  
To speed up repeated builds, you can use the **configure cache**, which saves previous results:  

.. code-block:: sh

    ./configure -C

### **Benefits**
- **Faster rebuilds**: Avoids redundant system checks, making subsequent runs quicker.  
- **Improves development workflow**: Speeds up the edit-configure-build-test cycle, especially for frequent changes.  
- **Reduces CPU and disk usage**: Skips unnecessary recomputation of configuration results.  

### **Clearing the Cache**
If you modify system settings, upgrade dependencies, or suspect cache-related issues,  
clear the cache before reconfiguring to avoid outdated settings:  

.. code-block:: sh

    rm -f config.cache

This ensures that `./configure` runs fresh system checks when necessary.  

### **When to Use `configure -C`**
- **Use it** when making minor code changes that don‚Äôt affect system dependencies.  
- **Avoid it** after system updates, compiler changes, or dependency modifications to prevent build inconsistencies.  

---

### **Why This Additional Detail?**
- **The `-C` flag behavior**: Makes it clear when to use or avoid it.  
- **Cache clearing instructions**: Important to prevent build failures due to stale configuration data.  
- **More structured benefits**: Helps new contributors understand why they should use it.

.. _configure-cache:

Using Configure Cache (`configure -C`)
--------------------------------------

### **Overview**  

When running `./configure`, CPython performs a series of system checks to detect available features, libraries, and compiler options. These checks help generate a proper `Makefile` for building CPython. However, a fresh configuration scan can take significant time, especially on slower systems or when running it frequently during development.  

To optimize this process, you can use the **configure cache** (`configure -C`), which saves the results of previous runs and reuses them for subsequent configurations.  

.. code-block:: sh

    ./configure -C

By caching detected system properties, this approach **eliminates redundant checks**, making reconfigurations significantly faster.  

---

### **Benefits of Using Configure Cache**  

Using `configure -C` can enhance the development workflow in multiple ways:  

- **Speeds up rebuilds**: Avoids rechecking system dependencies, making incremental changes quicker.  
- **Reduces system load**: Skips redundant computations, lowering CPU usage.  
- **Improves iteration time**: Speeds up the edit-configure-build-test cycle, especially for developers frequently modifying CPython‚Äôs internals.  
- **Ensures consistency**: Maintains uniform configuration settings across multiple runs unless the cache is explicitly cleared.

### **When to Use `configure -C`?**  

| Scenario                                      | Use `configure -C`? | Reason |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Small code changes (e.g., modifying `.c` files) | ‚úÖ Yes           | Avoids unnecessary reconfiguration steps. |
| Frequent rebuilds without system changes      | ‚úÖ Yes           | Saves time and system resources. |
| Upgrading system libraries (e.g., OpenSSL)    | ‚ùå No            | Cache may store outdated results, leading to inconsistencies. |
| Changing compiler settings or flags           | ‚ùå No            | A fresh `./configure` run is needed to reflect changes. |
| Switching between Python build environments   | ‚ùå No            | Using cache might introduce conflicts between builds. |

---

### **Clearing the Configure Cache**  

If you have modified system settings, upgraded dependencies, or changed compiler options, it's recommended to **clear the cache** before re-running `./configure` to avoid build inconsistencies.  

To remove the cached configuration results, use:  

.. code-block:: sh

    rm -f config.cache

This ensures that `./configure` performs a fresh system scan, preventing potential errors due to stale configuration data.  

**Best Practice**: If you encounter unexpected build issues after using `configure -C`, try clearing the cache first before debugging further.  

---

### **Additional Notes**  

- `configure -C` only **caches successful test results**. If a check fails, it will still be re-run in subsequent configurations.  
- Some system changes might not require clearing the cache, but if in doubt, it's safer to remove it.  
- The cache is stored in `config.cache` in the build directory and is automatically used if present when `configure -C` is executed.  

---

### **Summary**  

- `./configure -C` caches system checks to speed up rebuilds.  
- Recommended for frequent code changes but **not** for system or compiler updates.  
- Clear the cache using `rm -f config.cache` when necessary.  

By following these guidelines, you can make the most out of `configure -C` while ensuring stable and efficient builds.
