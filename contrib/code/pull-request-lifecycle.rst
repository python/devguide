[Details of pull requests for code contributions. The existing
:ref:`pull-request-lifecycle` page is long and includes many details.
Some only apply to code contributions, but many are common to all
contributions.  Should we keep a common page, with extra steps here, or
should this page have all of the details even if they are duplicated
elsewhere?]

[See :ref:`docs-pull-request-lifecycle` for the documentation half of this conundrum.]
