[Plan for the Contributor's Guide]
==================================

.. important::

   |draft|

   |purpose|

We are in the process of updating and refactoring the devguide to be a
Contributor's Guide.  It will highlight the different kinds of contribution
possible, and how to succeed at each kind.

Currently, the Contibutor's Guide is a draft in this new last section of the
devguide.  We welcome feedback, but please understand that some of the current
content is moving or skeletal.

Repo structure
==============

While the reorganization is happening, we are keeping the old devguide as it
is.  The new Contributor's Guide is represented in this last section, but will
eventually be the only content in the guide.  To avoid copying content, we're
using Sphinx include directives to display existing devguide content in its new
Contributor's Guide location.  That is not how the eventual Guide will be
built.  Once we are ready to make the Contributor's Guide real, we will
rearrange content into its new location.
