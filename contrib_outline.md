# Outline for Contributor’s Guide

**DRAFT**

After thinking about how to create a documentation contribution guide from the devguide, I think it makes more sense to have one Contributor’s Guide with explicit sections for code and docs.

Here is a quick outline of how it could be structured.  “(from devguide)” means to use that section from the current devguide verbatim.

* Introduction
    * Importance of healthy inclusive collaboration (While code is a large part of the project's success, project management, documentation, governance, sprint outreach, etc. matter). We respect the individual skills people bring to the project and strive to create and maintain a culture of inclusion.
    * About this guide
    * Types of contribution (Pathways for Contributors)
    * Helping with the Contributors' Guide
* The CPython project
    * Structure
    * CoC
        * Standard for communication
        * Enforcement details
    * Roles
        * Core teamdevelopers (from devguide)
        * (SC?) (EB?)
        * Triager
        * Contributors
            * types of contributions, role of each contributors
    * Governance
        * (SC?) (EB?)
        * Other WG? Typing council? C-API WG?
    * GitHub
        * Main CPython rRepos
        * Core workflow repos
        * Infrastructure repos
    * Communication channels
        * Repos
        * Discourse
        * Discord
        * Mailing lists (deprioritize)
        * Where to get help
    * Issue triaging
        * (How exactly? Guidelines? Is it just about applying labels?)
        * Easy issues
        * (should triagers assign reviewers?)
        * (should triagers close issues?)
    * (Reviewing)
        * How? Etiquette?
        * How to request a review?
    * Where to get help
* Getting started
    * Basic setup
    * Git bootcamp (simplified for everyone to use)
* Code contributions
    * Code setup and building (more complex stuff, delta from basic setup above)
    * More git bootcamp (patches, etc)
    * Lifecycle of a code pull request
    * Development workflow (from devguide)
    * Testing and buildbots (from devguide)
    * Development tools (from devguide)
    * CPython’s internals (from devguide)
    * Code style guide
* Documentation contributions
    * Lifecycle of a docs pull request
    * (pull in Documentation sections from devguide)
    * Rst/Sphinx bootcamp
    * Editorial Style Guide
* Translation
    * Need details
* Accessibility and user success
* Security and infrastructure
    * Core Team Resources (from the devguide: I think we should reevaluate if it still makes sense to have the "How to become a core developer" section in this guide and in this particular section.)
