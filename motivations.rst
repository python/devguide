Motivations and Affiliations
============================

CPython core contributors participate in the core development process for a
variety of reasons. Being accepted as a core contributor indicates only that
an individual is interested in acquiring those responsibilities, has the
ability to collaborate effectively with existing core contributors, and has had
the time available to demonstrate both that interest and that ability.

This page allows core contributors that choose to do so to provide more
information to the rest of the Python community regarding their personal
motivations for participating in the core development process (which can be
admittedly trying at times), as well as any personal and professional
affiliations which they consider particularly relevant.

Core contributors that wish to provide this additional information add a new
entry to the :ref:`published-motivations` section below. Guidelines relating
to content and layout are included as comments in the source code for this page.

Core contributors that are available for training, consulting or contract work,
or are seeking crowdfunding support for their community contributions, may also
choose to disclose that information here (including linking out to commercial
sites with the relevant details).

Limitations on scope
--------------------

Changes to the software and documentation maintained by core contributors,
together with related design discussions, all take place in public venues, and
hence can be fully audited by anyone that cares to do so. Accordingly, core
contributors are NOT required to publish their motivations and affiliations if
they do not choose to do so. This helps to ensure that core contribution
processes remain open to anyone that is in a position to sign the `Contributor
Licensing Agreement`_, the details of which are filed privately with the Python
Software Foundation, rather than publicly.

.. _Contributor Licensing Agreement: https://www.python.org/psf/contrib/contrib-form/

While providing additional information on this page is entirely optional,
contributors that are not facing personal safety concerns are specifically
encouraged to disclose commercial affiliations in the following two cases
(even if not currently paid for time spent participating in the core
development process):

* contributors working for vendors that distribute a commercially supported
  Python runtime
* contributors working for Sponsor Members of the Python Software Foundation

These are cases where disclosure of commercial interests helps to improve the
overall transparency of the core development process, as well as making it
easier for staff at these organisations to locate colleagues that can help
them to participate in and contribute effectively to supporting the core
development process.

Contributors that are available for consulting or contract work on behalf of
the Python Software Foundation or other organisations are also encouraged
to provide that information here, as this will help the PSF to better
facilitate funding of core development work by organisations that don't
directly employ any core contributors themselves.

Published entries
-----------------

The following core contributors have chosen to provide additional details
regarding their reasons for participating in the CPython core development
process:

.. Entry guidelines:

   We use the "topic" directive rather than normal section headings in order to
   avoid creating entries in the main table of contents.

   Topic headings should be in the form of "Name (Country)" to help give some
   indication as to the geographic dispersal of core contributors.

   Entries should be written as short third person biographies, rather than
   being written in first person.

   Entries should be maintained in alphabetical order by last name, or by first
   name (relative to other last names) if "last name" isn't a meaningful term
   for your name.

   Include a "Personal site" bullet point with a link if you'd like to highlight
   a personal blog or other site.

   Include an "Extended bio" bullet point with a link if you'd like to provide
   more than a couple of paragraphs of biographical information. (Use a
   double-trailing underscore on these links to avoid "Duplicate explicit
   target name" warnings from Sphinx/docutils)

   Include an "Available for <activity>" (or activities) bullet point with a
   link if you'd like to be contacted for professional training, consulting or
   contract work. A link to a page with additional details is preferred to a
   direct email address or contact phone number, as this is a global site, and
   folks may not be familiar with the relevant practical details that apply to
   this kind of work in a contributor's country of residence.

   Include a "Crowdfunding" bullet point with a link if you'd like to highlight
   crowdfunding services (e.g. Patreon) that folks can use to support your core
   development work.

   Include additional bullet points (without links) for any other affiliations
   you would like to mention.

   If there's a kind of link you'd like to include in your entry that isn't
   already covered by the categories mentioned above, please start a discussion
   about that on the python-committers mailing list.

   python-committers is also the appropriate point of contact for any other
   questions or suggestions relating to this page.


.. topic:: Nick Coghlan (Australia)

  * Personal site: `Curious Efficiency <http://www.curiousefficiency.org/>`_
  * `Extended bio <http://www.curiousefficiency.org/pages/about>`__
  * Red Hat (Software Engineer, Developer Experience)
  * Python Software Foundation (Board of Directors)

  Nick originally began participating in CPython core development as an
  interesting and enlightening hobby activity while working for Boeing Defence
  Australia. After commencing work for Red Hat, he also became involved in a
  range of topics related directly to improving the experience of Python
  developers on the Fedora Linux distribution and derived platforms, and now
  works for Red Hat's Developer Experience team.

  In addition to his personal and professional interest in ensuring Python
  remains an excellent choice for Linux-based network service development, he
  is also interested in helping to ensure its continued suitability for
  educational and data analysis use cases.
