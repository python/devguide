How to Become a Core Developer
==============================

What it Takes
=============

When you have consistently contributed patches which meet quality standards
without requiring extensive rewrites prior to being committed,
you may qualify for commit privileges and become a core developer of Python.
You must also work well with other core developers (and people in general)
as you become an ambassador for the Python project.

Typically a core developer will offer you the chance to gain commit privilege.
The person making the offer will become your mentor and watch your commits for
a while to make sure you understand the development process. If other core
developers agree that you should gain commit privileges you are then extended
an official offer. How core developers come to that agreement are outlined in
:pep:`13`.


Gaining Commit Privileges
=========================

The steps to gaining commit privileges are:

1. A core developer starts a poll at https://discuss.python.org/c/committers/5

   - Open for 7 days
   - Results shown upon close

2. The poll is announced on python-committers
3. Wait for the poll to close and see if the results confirm your membership
   as per the voting results required by PEP 13
4. The person who nominated you emails the steering council with your email
   address and a request that the council either accept or reject the proposed
   membership
5. Assuming the steering council does not object, a member of the council will
   email you asking for:

   - Account details as required by
     ðŸ”’ https://github.com/python/voters/
   - Your preferred email address to
     subscribe to python-committers with
   - A reminder about the `Code of Conduct`_ and to report issues to the PSF
     Conduct WG

6. Once you have provided the pertinent details, your various new privileges
   will be turned on
7. Your details will be added to ðŸ”’ https://github.com/python/voters/
8. They will update the devguide to publicly list your team membership at
   :ref:`developers`
9. An announcement email by the steering council member handling your new
   membership will be sent to python-committers
