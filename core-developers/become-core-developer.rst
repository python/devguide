How to Become a Core Developer
==============================

What it Takes
=============

When you have consistently contributed patches which meet quality standards
without requiring extensive rewrites prior to being committed,
you may qualify for commit privileges and become a core developer of Python.
You must also work well with other core developers (and people in general)
as you become an ambassador for the Python project.

Typically a core developer will offer you the chance to gain commit privilege.
The person making the offer will become your mentor and watch your commits for
a while to make sure you understand the development process. If other core
developers agree that you should gain commit privileges you are then extended
an official offer. How core developers come to that agreement are outlined in
:pep:`13`.


Gaining Commit Privileges
=========================

After a candidate has demonstrated consistent contributions, commit privileges
are granted through these steps:

#. A core developer (submitter, usually the mentor) starts a poll in the
   `Committers category`_ on the `Python Discourse`_ and cross-posts it to
   the `python-committers mailing list`_.

   - Open for 7 days
   - Results shown upon close

#. If the candidate receives at least two-thirds positive votes when the poll closes
   (as per :pep:`13`), the submitter `emails the steering council
   <mailto:steering-council@python.org>`_ with the candidate's email address
   requesting that the council either accept or reject the proposed membership.

#. Assuming the steering council does not object, a member of the council or delegate
   (approver) will email the candidate:

   - A request for account details as required by
     `ðŸ”’ python/voters <https://github.com/python/voters>`_
   - A request for the committer's preferred address for subscription to
     the `python-committers mailing list`_
   - A reminder about the `Code of Conduct`_ and guidance on reporting issues
     to the PSF Conduct WG

#. Once the candidate has provided the pertinent details, the approver will:

   - enable the various new privileges;
   - add the new committer's details to
     `ðŸ”’ python/voters <https://github.com/python/voters>`_;
   - update the devguide to publicly list the new committer's team membership
     at :ref:`developers`;
   - send an announcement email to the Committers Discourse category.
