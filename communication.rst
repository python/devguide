Following Python's Development
==============================

Python's development is communicated through a myriad of ways, mostly through
mailing lists, but also other forms.

.. _mailinglists:

Mailing Lists
-------------

The primary mailing list where discussions about Python's development occur is
python-dev_. The list is open to the public and is subscribed to by all core
developers plus many people simply interested in following Python's
development. Discussion is focused on issues related to Python's development,
such as how to handle a specific issue, a PEP, etc. Ideas about new
functionality should **not** start here and instead should be sent to
python-ideas_. Technical support questions should also not be asked here and
instead should go to python-list_ or python-help_.

The python-committers_ mailing list is a private mailing list for core
developers (the archives are publicly available).
If something only affects core developers (e.g., the
tree is frozen for commits, etc.), it is discussed here instead of python-dev
to keep traffic down on the latter.

Python-ideas_ is a mailing list open to the public to discuss ideas on changing
Python. If a new idea does not start here (or python-list_, discussed below),
it will get redirected here.

Python-checkins_ sends out an email for every commit to Python's various
repositories from https://github.com/python/cpython. All core developers
subscribe to this list and are known to reply to these emails to make comments
about various issues they catch in the commit. Replies get redirected to
python-dev.

There are two mailing lists related to issues on the `issue tracker`_. If you
only want an email for when a new issue is open, subscribe to
new-bugs-announce_. If you would rather receive an email for all changes made
to any issue, subscribe to python-bugs-list_.

Sometimes people post new ideas to python-list_ to gather community opinion before
heading to python-ideas_. The list is also sometimes known as comp.lang.python,
the name of the newsgroup is mirrors (it is also known by the abbreviation
c.l.py).

A complete list of Python mailing lists can be found at http://mail.python.org.
Most lists are also mirrored at http://news.gmane.org/ and can be read and
posted to in various ways, including via web browsers, NNTP newsreaders, and
RSS feed readers.

IRC
---

Some core developers enjoy spending time on IRC discussing various issues
regarding Python's development in the ``#python-dev`` channel on
``irc.freenode.net``. This is not a place to ask for help with Python, but to
discuss issues related to Python's own development.  You can use freenode's
`Web interface <http://webchat.freenode.net/>`_ if you don't have an IRC
client.


Blogs
-----

Several core developers are active bloggers and discuss Python's development
that way. You can find their blogs (and various other developers who use Python)
at http://planet.python.org/.
