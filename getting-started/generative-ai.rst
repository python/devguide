Generative AI
=============

Generative AI has evolved rapidly over the past decade and will continue in the future.
Using generative AI and large language models (LLMs) can be helpful tools for contributors.
Their overuse can also be problematic, such as generation of incorrect code, inaccurate documentation, and unneeded code churn.
Discretion, good judgement, and critical thinking **must** be used when opening issues and pull requests.

Acceptable uses
===============

Some of the acceptable uses of generative AI include:

- Assistance with writing comments, especially in a non-native language
- Gaining understanding of existing code
- Supplementing contributor knowledge for code, tests, and documentation

Unacceptable uses
=================

If a maintainer believes that a PR or issue was **fully generated** by AI tools, the PR or issue will be closed.
If a contributor opens multiple fully AI-generated issues or PRs, the contributor may be blocked.
