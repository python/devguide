Where to get help
=================

If you are working on Python it is very possible you will come across an issue
where you need some assistance to solve it (this happens to core developers
all the time).

Should you require help, there are a :ref:`variety of options available
<communication>` to seek assistance. If the question involves process or tool
usage then please check the rest of this guide first as it should answer your
question.


.. _help-discourse:

Discourse
---------

Python has a hosted Discourse instance at `discuss.python.org <Discourse_>`_.
This forum has many different categories,
most of which are open for all users to read and post.
Those particularly relevant for help contributing to Python itself include:

* `Core Development`_ for most general questions and help
* `Ideas`_ to discuss new ideas for the Python language
* `Core Workflow`_ for questions about the dev infrastructure and bots

.. seealso::
  :ref:`communication-discourse` for more information on how to get started.

.. _Core Development: https://discuss.python.org/c/core-dev/23
.. _Core Workflow: https://discuss.python.org/c/core-workflow/8
.. _Ideas: https://discuss.python.org/c/ideas/6


.. _help-mailing-lists:

Mailing lists
-------------

Further options for seeking assistance include the
`python-ideas`_ and `python-dev`_ mailing lists,
which correspond to the `Ideas`_ and `Core Development`_
:ref:`help-discourse` categories, respectively.
The Discourse categories are generally more active
and are the preferred venue for new discussions,
but the mailing lists are still monitored and responded to.
These mailing lists are for questions involving the
development *of* Python, **not** for development *with* Python.

.. _python-dev: https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/python-dev.python.org/


Ask #python-dev
---------------

If you are comfortable with IRC you can try asking on ``#python-dev`` (on
the `Libera.Chat`_ network). Typically there are a number of experienced
developers, ranging from triagers to core developers, who can answer
questions about developing for Python.  As with the mailing lists,
``#python-dev`` is for questions involving the development *of* Python
whereas ``#python`` is for questions concerning development *with* Python.

.. note::

  You may not be able to access the history of this channel, so it cannot
  be used as a "knowledge base" of sorts.

Core mentorship
---------------

If you are interested in improving Python and contributing to its development,
but donâ€™t yet feel entirely comfortable with the public channels mentioned
above, `Python Mentors`_ are here to help you.  Python is fortunate to have a
community of volunteer core developers willing to mentor anyone wishing to
contribute code, work on bug fixes or improve documentation.  Everyone is
welcomed and encouraged to contribute.

File a bug
----------

If you strongly suspect you have stumbled on a bug (be it in the build
process, in the test suite, or in other areas), then open an issue on the
`issue tracker`_.  As with every bug report it is strongly advised that
you detail which conditions triggered it (including the OS name and version,
and what you were trying to do), as well as the exact error message you
encountered.
