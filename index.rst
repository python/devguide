This guide is a comprehensive resource for :ref:`contributing <contributing>`
to Python_ -- for both new and experienced contributors. It is 
:ref:`maintained <helping-with-the-developers-guide>` by the same
community that maintains Python.  We welcome your contributions to Python!

.. _quick-reference:

Quick Reference
---------------

Here are the basic steps needed to get :ref:`set up <setup>` and contribute a
patch. This is meant as a checklist, once you know the basics. For complete
instructions please see the :ref:`setup guide <setup>`.

1. Install and set up :ref:`Git <vcsetup>` and other dependencies
   (see the :ref:`Get Setup <setup>` page for detailed information).

2. Fork `the CPython repository <https://github.com/python/cpython>`_
   to your GitHub account and :ref:`get the source code <checkout>` using::

      git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/cpython

3. Build Python, on UNIX and Mac OS use::

      ./configure --with-pydebug && make -j

   and on Windows use:

   .. code-block:: dosbatch

      PCbuild\build.bat -e -d

   See also :ref:`more detailed instructions <compiling>`,
   :ref:`how to build dependencies <build-dependencies>`, and the
   plaform-specific pages for :ref:`UNIX <unix-compiling>`,
   :ref:`Mac OS <MacOS>`, and :ref:`Windows <windows-compiling>`.

4. :doc:`Run the tests <runtests>`::

      ./python -m test -j3

   On :ref:`most <mac-python.exe>` Mac OS X systems, replace :file:`./python`
   with :file:`./python.exe`.  On Windows, use :file:`python.bat`.  With Python
   2.7, replace ``test`` with ``test.regrtest``.

5. Create a new branch where your work for the issue will go, e.g.::

      git checkout -b fix-issue-12345 master

   If an issue does not already exist, please `create it
   <https://bugs.python.org/>`_.  Trivial issues (e.g. typo fixes) do not
   require any issue to be created.

6. Once you fixed the issue, run the tests, run ``make patchcheck``, and if
   everything is ok, commit.

7. Push the branch on your fork on GitHub and :doc:`create a pull request
   <pullrequest>`.  Include the issue number using ``bpo-NNNN`` in the
   pull request description.  For example::

      bpo-12345: Fix some bug in spam module

.. note::

   First time contributors will need to sign the Contributor Licensing
   Agreement (CLA) as described in the :ref:`Licensing <cla>` section of
   this guide.

Status:

:features: new features are only added to the master branch, this branch
    accepts any kind of change.
:prerelease: feature fixes, bugfixes and security fixes are accepted for the
    upcoming feature release.
:bugfix: bugfixes and security fixes are accepted, new binaries are still
    released.
:security: only security fixes are accepted and no more binaries are released,
    but new source-only versions can be released
:end-of-life: release cycle is frozen; no further changes can be pushed to it.

Dates in *italic* are scheduled and can be adjusted.

By default, the end-of-life is scheduled 5 years after the first release.  It
can be adjusted by the release manager of each branch. Versions older than 2.7
have reached end-of-life.

See also :ref:`Security branches <secbranch>`.

Each release of Python is tagged in the source repo with a tag of the form
``vX.Y.ZTN``, where ``X`` is the major version, ``Y`` is the
minor version, ``Z`` is the micro version, ``T`` is the release level
(``a`` for alpha releases, ``b`` for beta, ``rc`` release candidate,
and *null* for final releases), and ``N`` is the release serial number.
Some examples of release tags: ``v3.7.0a1``, ``v3.6.3``, ``v2.7.14rc1``.

The code base for a release cycle which has reached end-of-life status
is frozen and no longer has a branch in the repo.  The final state of
the end-of-lifed branch is recorded as a tag with the same name as the
former branch, e.g. ``3.3`` or ``2.6``.  For reference, here are the
most recently end-of-lifed release cycles:

Contributing
------------

We encourage everyone to contribute to Python and that's why we have put up this
developer's guide.  If you still have questions after reviewing the material in
this guide, then the `Core Python Mentorship`_ group is available to help guide new
contributors through the process.

A number of individuals from the Python community have contributed to a series
of excellent guides at `Open Source Guides <https://opensource.guide/>`_.

Core developers and contributors alike will find the following guides useful:

* `How to Contribute to Open Source <https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/>`_
* `Building Welcoming Communities <https://opensource.guide/building-community/>`_

Advanced tasks and topics for once you are comfortable:

* :doc:`silencewarnings`
* Fixing issues found by the :doc:`buildbots <buildbots>`
* :doc:`coverity`
* Helping out with reviewing `open pull requests`_.
  See :ref:`how to review a Pull Request <how-to-review-a-pull-request>`.
* :doc:`fixingissues`

It is **recommended** that the above documents be read as needed. New 
contributors will build understanding of the CPython workflow by reading the
sections mentioned in this table. You
can stop where you feel comfortable and begin contributing immediately without
reading and understanding these documents all at once.  If you do choose to skip
around within the documentation, be aware that it is written assuming preceding
documentation has been read so you may find it necessary to backtrack to fill in
missing concepts and terminology.


Proposing changes to Python itself
----------------------------------

Improving Python's code, documentation and tests are ongoing tasks that are
never going to be "finished", as Python operates as part of an ever-evolving
system of technology.  An even more challenging ongoing task than these
necessary maintenance activities is finding ways to make Python, in the form of
the standard library and the language definition, an even better tool in a
developer's toolkit.

While these kinds of change are much rarer than those described above, they do
happen and that process is also described as part of this guide:

* :doc:`stdlibchanges`
* :doc:`langchanges`


Other Interpreter Implementations
---------------------------------

This guide is specifically for contributing to the Python reference interpreter,
also known as CPython (while most of the standard library is written in Python,
the interpreter core is written in C and integrates most easily with the C and
C++ ecosystems).

There are other Python implementations, each with a different focus.  Like
CPython, they always have more things they would like to do than they have
developers to work on them.  Some major example that may be of interest are:

* PyPy_: A Python interpreter focused on high speed (JIT-compiled) operation
  on major platforms
* Jython_: A Python interpreter focused on good integration with the Java
  Virtual Machine (JVM) environment
* IronPython_: A Python interpreter focused on good integration with the
  Common Language Runtime (CLR) provided by .NET and Mono
* Stackless_: A Python interpreter focused on providing lightweight
  microthreads while remaining largely compatible with CPython specific
  extension modules

Code of Conduct
---------------
Please note that all interactions on
`Python Software Foundation <https://www.python.org/psf-landing/>`__-supported
infrastructure is `covered

which includes all infrastructure used in the development of Python itself
(e.g. mailing lists, issue trackers, GitHub, etc.).
In general this means everyone is expected to be open, considerate, and
