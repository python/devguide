Contributing

We encourage everyone to contribute to Python and that's why we have put up
this developer's guide. If you still have questions after reviewing the
material in this guide, then the `Python Mentors`_ group is available to help
guide new contributors through the process. The :doc:`Developer FAQ <faq>` is
another useful source of information.

It is **recommended** that the above documents be read in the order listed.
You can stop where you feel comfortable and begin contributing immediately
without reading and understanding these documents all at once. If you do
choose to skip around within the documentation, be aware that it is written
assuming preceding documentation has been read so you may find it necessary
to backtrack to fill in missing concepts and terminology.
