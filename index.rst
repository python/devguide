========================
Python Developer's Guide
========================

This guide is a comprehensive resource for :ref:`contributing <contributing>`
to Python_ -- for both new and experienced contributors.  It is
:ref:`maintained <helping-with-the-developers-guide>` by the same community
that maintains Python.  We welcome your contributions to Python!


Quick Start
-----------

Here are the basic steps needed to get :ref:`set up <setup>` and contribute a
patch:

1. Set up and install dependencies.

   Install :ref:`Mercurial <vcsetup>` and other dependencies.

   The dependencies needed will depend on the platform you're on.
   Go to :ref:`Get Setup <setup>` page for detailed information.

2. :ref:`Get the source code <checkout>`::

      hg clone https://hg.python.org/cpython


3. Build Python.

   Detailed information can be found :ref:`here <compiling>`.
   There are different instructions for :ref:`UNIX <unix-compiling>`,
   :ref:`Mac OS <MacOS>`, and :ref:`Windows <windows-compiling>`.

   The command to compile on UNIX is::

      ./configure
      make -j2

   On some Mac OS:::

      CPPFLAGS="-I$(brew --prefix openssl)/include" \
      LDFLAGS="-L$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib" \
      ./configure --with-pydebug

   On Windows:::

      PCbuild\build.bat -e -d

   If the build outputs warnings or errors, :ref:`build-dependencies` provides
   detail on standard library extensions that depend on installing third-party
   libraries for some operating systems.

4. :doc:`Run the tests <runtests>`::

      ./python -m test -j3

   On :ref:`most <mac-python.exe>` Mac OS X systems, replace :file:`./python`
   with :file:`./python.exe`.  On Windows, use :file:`python.bat` or
   check the :ref:`Windows instructions <win-python.exe>`.  With Python 2.7,
   replace ``test`` with ``test.regrtest``.
5. Make the :doc:`patch <patch>`.
6. Submit it to the `issue tracker`_.

Status:

:features: new features are only added to the default branch, this branch
    accepts any kind of change.
:bugfix: bugfixes and security fixes are accepted, new binaries are still
    released.
:security: only security fixes are accepted and no more binaries are released,
    but new source-only versions can be released
:end-of-life: branch no longer maintained; no more changes can be pushed to
    this branch.

Dates in *italic* are scheduled and can be adjusted.

By default, the end-of-life is scheduled 5 years after the first release.  It
can be adjusted by the release manager of each branch. Versions older than 2.6
have reached end-of-life.

.. _contributing:

Contributing
------------

We encourage everyone to contribute to Python and that's why we have put up this
developer's guide.  If you still have questions after reviewing the material in
this guide, then the `Python Mentors`_ group is available to help guide new
contributors through the process.  The :doc:`Developer FAQ <faq>` is another
useful source of information.

Guide for contributing to Python:

* :doc:`setup`
* :doc:`help`
* :doc:`patch`
* :doc:`runtests`
* Beginner tasks to become familiar with the development process
    * :doc:`docquality`
    * :doc:`coverage`
* Advanced tasks for once you are comfortable
    * :doc:`silencewarnings`
    * Fixing issues found by the :doc:`buildbots <buildbots>`
    * :doc:`fixingissues`
* :ref:`tracker` and :ref:`helptriage`
    * :doc:`triaging`
    * :doc:`experts`
* :doc:`communication`
* :doc:`coredev`
    * :doc:`committing`
    * :doc:`devcycle`
    * :doc:`buildbots`
    * :doc:`coverity`
* :doc:`gitdevs`

It is **recommended** that the above documents be read in the order listed.  You
can stop where you feel comfortable and begin contributing immediately without
reading and understanding these documents all at once.  If you do choose to skip
around within the documentation, be aware that it is written assuming preceding
documentation has been read so you may find it necessary to backtrack to fill in
missing concepts and terminology.


Proposing changes to Python itself
----------------------------------

Improving Python's code, documentation and tests are ongoing tasks that are
never going to be "finished", as Python operates as part of an ever-evolving
system of technology.  An even more challenging ongoing task than these
necessary maintenance activities is finding ways to make Python, in the form of
the standard library and the language definition, an even better tool in a
developer's toolkit.

While these kinds of change are much rarer than those described above, they do
happen and that process is also described as part of this guide:

* :doc:`stdlibchanges`
* :doc:`langchanges`

Also refer to :ref:`suggesting-changes` in the FAQ.


Other Interpreter Implementations
---------------------------------

This guide is specifically for contributing to the Python reference interpreter,
also known as CPython (while most of the standard library is written in Python,
the interpreter core is written in C and integrates most easily with the C and
C++ ecosystems).

There are other Python implementations, each with a different focus.  Like
CPython, they always have more things they would like to do than they have
developers to work on them.  Some major example that may be of interest are:

* PyPy_: A Python interpreter focused on high speed (JIT-compiled) operation
  on major platforms
* Jython_: A Python interpreter focused on good integration with the Java
  Virtual Machine (JVM) environment
* IronPython_: A Python interpreter focused on good integration with the
  Common Language Runtime (CLR) provided by .NET and Mono
* Stackless_: A Python interpreter focused on providing lightweight
  microthreads while remaining largely compatible with CPython specific
  extension modules
