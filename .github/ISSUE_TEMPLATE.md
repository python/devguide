# Devguide Issue

Note: This repo is for the Python devguide. If you are reporting an issue or
enhancement for the standard library, then the CPython issue tracker is better
suited for this report: https://bugs.python.org

Please provide more information to help us understand the issue:

* Are you reporting a bug, or opening a new enhancement request?
* If a bug, what is the actual documentation change needed?
* If a bug, what is the documentation that you expect?
* If a new enhancement request, what documentation should be added and
  why do you feel it is an important addition?
