# Contributing to the Devguide

## Thank You

First off, thanks for contributing to the devguide of the Python programming
language! Even if your contribution is not ultimately accepted, the fact you
put time and effort into helping out is greatly appreciated.


## Contribution Guidelines

Please read this [devguide](https://devguide.python.org/) for
guidance on how to contribute to this project. The documentation covers
everything from how to build the code to submitting a pull request. There are
also suggestions on how you can most effectively help the project.

Please be aware that our workflow does deviate slightly from the typical GitHub
project. Details on how to properly submit a pull request are covered in
[Lifecycle of a Pull Request](https://devguide.python.org/pullrequest/).
We utilize various bots and status checks to help with this, so do follow the
comments they leave and their "Details" links, respectively.

The final key part of our workflow is that all discussions that are not
directly related to the code in the pull request should happen on the
[issue tracker](https://devguide.python.org/tracker/), generally in the
pull request's parent issue.


## Setting Expectations

Due to the fact that this project is entirely volunteer-run (that is, no one is paid
to work on Python full-time), we unfortunately can make no guarantees as to if
or when a core developer will get around to reviewing your pull request.
If no core developer has done a review or responded to changes made because of a
"changes requested" review, please consider seeking assistance through the
[Core Development Discourse category](https://discuss.python.org/c/core-dev/23).


## Code of Conduct

All interactions for this project are covered by the
[PSF Code of Conduct](https://policies.python.org/python.org/code-of-conduct/). Everyone is
expected to be open, considerate, and respectful of others no matter their
position within the project.
