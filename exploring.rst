Exploring CPython's Internals
=============================

This is a quick guide for people who are interested in learning more about
CPython's internals. It provides a summary of the source code structure
and contains references to resources providing a more in-depth view.


CPython Source Code Layout
--------------------------

This guide gives an overview of CPython's code structure.
It serves as a summary of file locations for modules and builtins.

For Python modules, the typical layout is:

* :file:`Lib/{<module>}.py`
* :file:`Modules/_{<module>}.c` (if there's also a C accelerator module)
* :file:`Lib/test/test_{<module>}.py`
* :file:`Doc/library/{<module>}.rst`

For extension-only modules, the typical layout is:

* :file:`Modules/{<module>}module.c`
* :file:`Lib/test/test_{<module>}.py`
* :file:`Doc/library/{<module>}.rst`

For builtin types, the typical layout is:

* :file:`Objects/{<builtin>}object.c`
* :file:`Lib/test/test_{<builtin>}.py`
* :file:`Doc/library/stdtypes.rst`

For builtin functions, the typical layout is:

* :file:`Python/bltinmodule.c`
* :file:`Lib/test/test_builtin.py`
* :file:`Doc/library/functions.rst`

Some exceptions:

* builtin type ``int`` is at :file:`Objects/longobject.c`
* builtin type ``str`` is at :file:`Objects/unicodeobject.c`
* builtin module ``sys`` is at :file:`Python/sysmodule.c`
* builtin module ``marshal`` is at :file:`Python/marshal.c`
* Windows-only module ``winreg`` is at :file:`PC/winreg.c`

For over 20 years the CPython code base has been changing and evolving.
Here's a sample of resources about the architecture of CPython aimed at
building your understanding of both the 2.x and 3.x versions of CPython:
