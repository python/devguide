Developer Log
=============

This file is a running log of developers given commit privileges for Python.

The purpose is to provide some institutional memory of who was given access
and why.

The first entry starts in April 2005.  Newer entries should be added to the top.
Entries should include the name or initials of the project admin who made the
change or granted access.  The procedure for adding or removing users is
described in :ref:`altering-access`.

Note, when giving new commit permissions, be sure to get a contributor agreement
from the committer.  See https://www.python.org/psf/contrib/ for details.
Commit privileges should not be given until the contributor agreement has been
signed and received.

This file is encoded in UTF-8.  If the usual form for a name is not in
a Latin or extended Latin alphabet, make sure to include an ASCII
transliteration too.
