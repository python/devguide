Developer Log
=============

This file is a running log of developers given commit privileges for Python.

The purpose is to provide some institutional memory of who was given access
and why.

The first entry starts in April 2005.  In keeping with the style of
Misc/NEWS, newer entries should be added to the top.
Entries should include the initials of the
project admin who made the change or granted access.

Note, when giving new commit permissions, be sure to get a contributor
agreement from the committer.  See http://www.python.org/psf/contrib/
for details.  When the agreement is signed, please note it in this log.

This file is encoded in UTF-8.  If the usual form for a name is not in
a Latin or extended Latin alphabet, make sure to include an ASCII
transliteration too.
